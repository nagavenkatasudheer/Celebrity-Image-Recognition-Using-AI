# Celebrity-Image-Recognition-Using-AI

This project focuses on developing a system to identify and classify celebrity faces using AI and computer vision techniques. It uses facial detection and feature extraction to recognize celebrities from images with high accuracy. The system employs a deep learning model trained on a dataset of celebrity faces and integrates a user-friendly interface for image uploads and analysis.

Technologies such as Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV were utilized to ensure real-time performance and scalability. The system is ideal for applications like automated content tagging, media indexing, and event monitoring, showcasing the potential of AI in simplifying complex tasks efficiently
